# Hearts
A means of simulating [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts) games for competing AI bots

# How To Use

* Write a class that implements the Hearts.AI.IAgent interface
* Your AgentName should be a constant
* Edit the Hearts.Console.Settings.cs file to enter your bot into the simulation
* Select the number of games to be simulated
* Run

# Rules

* No decompiling or inspecting other peoples' bots / code without their permission
* No hacking / using accidentally exposed info your bot shouldn't have (yet... we might encourage this when the project is more mature)
* Try to beat each example bot before examining its code
* No delegating to other players' bots in a published DLL (it's fine for testing)
* If you think you might be cheating, ask, as we probably haven't thought of everything
* If your bot is currently winning, the idea is you switch to improving the core / framework / surrounding ecosystem to give the others a chance to catch-up, and to prevent one person dominating for too long
