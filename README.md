# Hearts
A means of simulating [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts) games for competing AI bots

# How To Use

* Write a class that implements the Hearts.AI.IAgent interface.
* Edit the Hearts.Console.Settings.cs file to enter your bot into the simulation
* Select the number of games to be simulated
* Run

# Rules

* No decompiling other peoples' bots
* No hacking / using accidentally exposed info your bot shouldn't have (yet... we mind encourage this when the project is more mature)
* Try to beat each example bot before examining its code
